# Object Detection Tool for ENSAM Meknes

This repository contains a machine learning tool designed to generate bounding boxes from a given set of classes that exist in images. This tool was developed as part of a novel architecture for training a prompt-based image segmentation model in a weakly supervised way.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this tool is to serve as a pedagogical resource for students studying Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at ENSAM Meknes. It provides an interactive way to understand and engage with the task of object detection.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: The tool can generate bounding boxes for a given set of classes present in images.
- **Interactive Learning**: The tool is designed to be user-friendly, promoting interactive learning of object detection tasks.
- **Google Colab Notebook**: A notebook is provided to test the tool using a free GPU on Google Colab.

## Getting Started

You can refer to the notebook "Getting Started" to quickly use the tool

We hope this tool aids in your understanding of object detection tasks in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. Your feedback and contributions to improve this tool are most welcome!
